                            <p>St. Joseph the Worker Pre & Primary Schools in their vision, mission, and philosophy are committed to offering holistic teaching, quality and values-driven education, and beneficial community service to cater for the needs and expectations of their students, employees, and parents. 
                            The Schools’ Quality Policy shall be communicated, understood, implemented, monitored, and reviewed at least every two years for continual suitability. 
                            Our schools shall develop and review their objectives and communicate them to all students, teaching staff, administrative staff, and support staff. 
                            Since our schools form a sort of community, all the people in it, either students, or employees, or members of the governing school board, must feel, each according to his or her own status, co-responsible for the common good and must strive to work for the schools’ goals. 
                            It also requires that students must faithfully observe the laws of the Schools about the general program and about discipline – in the first place about the study program, class attendance, and examinations – as well as all that pertains to the life of the Schools.</p>
