                            <p>St. Joseph the Worker Pre & Primary Schools were founded on the Catholic education tradition which stresses integral development of the human person, a development that includes both corporal and spiritual well-being. 
                            Our Schools promote academic excellence and endorse the quest for and communication of the whole truth about humanity, the cosmos, and God. 
                            Our conviction is that holistic approach to education which demands a values-driven education should permeate thought patterns, standards of judgments, and norms of behaviour and ultimately should enable students find meaning in life.</p>
